From their colorful graffiti-style art to booming music systems, matatus reflect the heartbeat of urban Kenya. They follow flexible routes and offer affordable travel, but navigating their system can be confusing for newcomers. Despite occasional chaos, they remain a symbol of freedom and youth culture in the city.",

    "content": "Boda bodas, or motorbike taxis, have become an essential part of Kenya's urban transport. Their ability to zip through traffic and reach narrow or remote areas makes them extremely convenient. However, safety remains a concern. Helmets are often ignored, and many riders lack proper training. As the industry grows, regulation and rider education will be vital for reducing accidents and improving reliability.",

    "content": "The Nairobi Expressway has significantly eased traffic flow for motorists traveling between Mlolongo, the CBD, and Westlands. It’s a toll road with digital and manual payment options. Though it saves time, toll fees can add up, especially during peak hours. Motorists should familiarize themselves with entry/exit points and consider the expressway only when time is more valuable than the toll cost.",
